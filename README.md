# Game Merchandising App

<h5 align="center">An end to end massive Full-Stack (MERN) e-commerce web application.</h5>

## üéØ About

### Overview of project

I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to create and structure a full-stack Web App of a mid-level complexity by integrating multiple technologies such as React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, React Hooks, React Router Dom, MaterialUI and more technologies.  
I've tried to follow best practices as much as possible and I've tried to make it scalable and maintainable. I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.  

The Web App redirects you to a Homepage which lists products, each product tile represents a game: you can click on its name and you will be redirected to the selected game/product detail component, a page that gives all details about the chosen product including images, review, recommended items and more. But in order to get most out of the app you need to sign up or to sign in: you can sign in with your custom account or with Demo account. Once you are logged in, you will be able to successfully make a purchase of a product, you will be provided all debit/credit details on the payment page.  
Also added Admin dashboard through which admin can manage inventory, orders, reviews, users and more.  

Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would appreciate it a lot.
